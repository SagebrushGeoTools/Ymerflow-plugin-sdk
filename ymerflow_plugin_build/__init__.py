"""Shared frontend-plugin build routine.

This package is intentionally dependency-free (stdlib only) so it can be imported from three
distinct places that converge on the *same* build code path:

1. The ``build_frontend_plugin`` process type (runs in a Kubernetes pod, or locally for tests).
2. A backend plugin's ``setup.py`` ``build_py`` command (builds at ``pip install`` time).
3. Local tests / a CLI (``python -m ymerflow_plugin_build ...``) so the whole
   build -> register -> serve -> load flow can be exercised on a dev machine *without* a cluster.

The routine resolves ``name@version`` from a **server-local npm source directory** and/or the
**public npm registry** (controlled by ``PLUGIN_NPM_SOURCE_MODE``: ``auto`` | ``local`` |
``registry``) and runs the real ``npm``/``vite`` Module-Federation build with ``shared`` pinned to
the host's exact singleton versions.
